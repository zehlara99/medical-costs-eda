# medical-costs-eda
This is a learning project where I did exploratory data analysis with a dataset containing medical insurance costs for different patients. I followed along an excellent tutorial on Statistics by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MarkKeith">Mark Keith</a>, so many thanks to him for sharing his knowledge!

It was a good practice of Python and Statistics, and throughout the code I've made a few comments and took some notes to better consolidate my learning.
